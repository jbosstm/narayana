/*
 * Encapsulation of a specialised data structure with API and performance characteristics
 * designed specifically for use by the transaction reaper.
 *
 * ReaperElements represent transactions which need timing out. To do this, the reaper needs
 * to wake periodically and process any timeouts that are due. New elements are added on transaction
 * creation and will be removed prior to their timeout if they terminate normally.
 *
 * For high concurrency, normal inserts and removes should not block. However, to determine the next element
 * which needs (will need) processing, the elements must be ordered or at least searched. These requirements
 * are in conflict, since ordering/searching requires stability i.e. locking.
 *
 * To achieve the desired performance characteristics, we combine two data structures: an unsorted, concurrent
 * collection and a sorted, non-threadsafe one which is guarded by the the ReaperElementManager instance lock.
 *
 * Inserts are done, potentially concurrently, to the unsorted hash set. Removes likewise check this first
 * and can return successfully without blocking if the element is found in this collection. Thus the insert/remove
 * are cheap operations.
 *
 * When it is required to know the smallest (i.e. earliest to timeout) element, the contents
 * of the unsorted set are moved to the sorted set. Since this happens infrequently compared to the insert/delete,
 * only a fraction of the elements inserted should ever be copied - most will be removed without ever migrating.
 *
 * Note that additional external synchronization will be needed to ensure first element does not change
 * between getFirst and any operation depending on its timeout value. This is the TransactionReaper's problem. 
 *
 * The sorted set is maintained manually, rather than using Collections.sort or other comparator based structure.
 * This is because compareTo on reaper elements is relatively expensive and we wish to avoid liner scans to minimise
 * the number of such calls. Hence we prefer ArrayList with binary search, despite the higher insert/remove cost
 * compared to LinkedList.
 *
 * Pay careful attention to locking and performance characteristics if altering this class.
