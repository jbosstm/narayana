ArjunaCore has been designed to be highly configurable at runtime
through the use of various property attributes, which will be
described in subsequent sections. Although these attributes can
be provided at runtime on the command line, it is possible (and
may be more convenient) to specify them through a single
properties file. At runtime ArjunaCore looks for the file
jbossts-properties.xml in the following order:
.sp 2
1. the current working directory, i.e., where the application was
   executed from.
.sp 2
2. the userâ€™s home directory.
.sp 2
3. the etc directory of the ArjunaCore installation; this must be
   placed in your \fICLASSPATH.\fR
.sp 2
If found, all entries within this file will be added to the
system properties. Obviously non- ArjunaCore specific properties
can also be specified in this file. For example:
.sp 2

.br
     <property
.br
	 name="com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.asyncCommit"
.br
	 value="NO"/>
.br
     <property
.br
	 name="com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.objectstore.objectStoreDir"
.br
	 value="c:\temp\ObjectStore"/>
.br
   
.sp 2
The name of the properties file can be overridden at runtime by
specifying a new file using the
\fIcom.arjuna.ats.arjuna.common.propertiesFile\fR attribute
variable.
