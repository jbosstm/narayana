  <title>Advanced transaction issues with TxCore</title>
  <para>
    Atomic actions (transactions) can be used by both application programmers and class developers. Thus entire
    operations (or parts of operations) can be made atomic as required by the semantics of a particular operation. This
    chapter will describe some of the more subtle issues involved with using transactions in general and TxCore in
    particular.

  </para>

  <section>
    <title>Last resource commit optimization (LRCO)</title>
    <para>
      In some cases it may be necessary to enlist participants that are not two-phase commit aware into a two-phase
      commit transaction. If there is only a single resource then there is no need for two-phase commit. However, if
      there are multiple resources in the transaction, the <firstterm>Last Resource Commit optimization
      (LRCO)</firstterm> comes into play. It is possible for a single resource that is one-phase aware (i.e., can only
      commit or roll back, with no prepare), to be enlisted in a transaction with two-phase commit aware resources. The
      coordinator treats the one-phase aware resource slightly differently, in that it executes the prepare phase on all
      other resource first, and if it then intends to commit the transaction it passes control to the one-phase aware
      resource. If it commits, then the coordinator logs the decision to commit and attempts to commit the other
      resources as well.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order to utilize the LRCO, your participant must implement the
      <interfacename>com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.OnePhase</interfacename> interface and be registered with the
      transaction through the <methodname>BasicAction.add</methodname> operation. Since this operation expects instances
      of <classname>AbstractRecord</classname>, you must create an instance of
      <classname>com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.LastResourceRecord</classname> and give your participant as the constructor
      parameter.
    </para>
    <example>
      <title>Class <classname>com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.LastResourceRecord</classname></title>
      <programlisting language="Java" role="JAVA"><xi:include href="extras/LastResourceRecord.java" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" /></programlisting>
    </example>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Nested transactions</title>
    <para>
      There are no special constructs for nesting of transactions. If an action is begun while another action is running
      then it is automatically nested. This allows for a modular structure to applications, whereby objects can be
      implemented using atomic actions within their operations without the application programmer having to worry about
      the applications which use them, and whether or not the applications will use atomic actions as well. Thus, in
      some applications actions may be top-level, whereas in others they may be nested. Objects written in this way can
      then be shared between application programmers, and TxCore will guarantee their consistency.
    </para>
    <para>
      If a nested action is aborted, all of its work will be undone, although strict two-phase locking means that
      any locks it may have obtained will be retained until the top-level action commits or aborts. If a nested action
      commits then the work it has performed will only be committed by the system if the top-level action commits. If
      the top-level action aborts then all of the work will be undone.
    </para>
    <para>
      The committing or aborting of a nested action does not automatically affect the outcome of the action within which
      it is nested. This is application dependent, and allows a programmer to structure atomic actions to contain
      faults, undo work, etc.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Asynchronously committing a transaction</title>
    <para>
      By default, the Transaction Service executes the <methodname>commit</methodname> protocol of a top-level
      transaction in a synchronous manner. All registered resources will be told to prepare in order by a single thread,
      and then they will be told to commit or rollback. This has several possible disadvantages:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          In the case of many registered resources, the <methodname>prepare</methodname> operating can logically be
          invoked in parallel on each resource. The disadvantage is that if an “early” resource in the list of
          registered resource forces a rollback during <methodname>prepare</methodname>, possibly many prepare
          operations will have been made needlessly.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          In the case where heuristic reporting is not required by the application, the second phase of the commit
          protocol can be done asynchronously, since its success or failure is not important.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Therefore, JBoss Transaction Service provides runtime options to enable possible threading optimizations. By
      setting the <varname>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.asyncPrepare</varname> environment variable to
      <literal>YES</literal>, during the <methodname>prepare</methodname> phase a separate thread will be created for
      each registered participant within the transaction. By setting
      <varname>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.asyncCommit</varname> to <literal>YES</literal>, a separate thread will be
      created to complete the second phase of the transaction if knowledge about heuristics outcomes is not required.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Independent top-level transactions</title>
    <para>
      In addition to normal top-level and nested atomic actions, TxCore also supports independent top-level actions,
      which can be used to relax strict serializability in a controlled manner. An independent top-level action can be
      executed from anywhere within another atomic action and behaves exactly like a normal top-level action. Its
      results are made permanent when it commits and will not be undone if any of the actions within which it was
      originally nested abort.

          <para>
            a typical nesting of atomic actions, where action B is nested within action A. Although atomic action C is
            logically nested within action B (it had its Begin operation invoked while B was active) because it is an
            independent top-level action, it will commit or abort independently of the other actions within the
            structure. Because of the nature of independent top-level actions they should be used with caution and only
            in situations where their use has been carefully examined.
          </para>
        </textobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    <para>
      Top-level actions can be used within an application by declaring and using instances of the class
      <classname>TopLevelTransaction</classname>. They are used in exactly the same way as other transactions.

    <title>Transactions within <methodname>save_state</methodname> and <methodname>restore_state</methodname>
    methods</title>
    <para>
      Exercise caution when writing the <methodname>save_state</methodname> and <methodname>restore_state</methodname>
      operations to ensure that no atomic actions are started, either explicitly in the operation or implicitly through
      use of some other operation. This restriction arises due to the fact that TxCore may invoke
      <methodname>restore_state</methodname> as part of its commit processing resulting in the attempt to execute an
      atomic action during the commit or abort phase of another action. This might violate the atomicity properties of
      the action being committed or aborted and is thus discouraged.

        If we consider the <xref linkend="array-example" /> given previously, the <methodname>set</methodname> and

  <section>
    <title>Garbage collecting objects</title>
    <para>
      Java objects are deleted when the garbage collector determines that they are no longer required. Deleting an
      object that is currently under the control of a transaction must be approached with caution since if the object is
      being manipulated within a transaction its fate is effectively determined by the transaction. Therefore,
      regardless of the references to a transactional object maintained by an application, TxCore will always retain its
      own references to ensure that the object is not garbage collected until after any transaction has terminated.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Transaction timeouts</title>
    <para>
      By default, transactions live until they are terminated by the application that created them or a failure
      occurs. However, it is possible to set a timeout (in seconds) on a per-transaction basis such that if the
      transaction has not terminated before the timeout expires it will be automatically rolled back.
    </para>
    <para>
      In TxCore, the timeout value is provided as a parameter to the <methodname>AtomicAction</methodname>
      constructor. If a value of <literal>AtomicAction.NO_TIMEOUT</literal> is provided (the default) then the
      transaction will not be automatically timed out. Any other positive value is assumed to be the timeout for the
      transaction (in seconds). A value of zero is taken to be a global default timeout, which can be provided by the
      property <varname>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.defaultTimeout</varname>, which has a default value of 60 seconds.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        Default timeout values for other JBoss Transaction Service components, such as JTS, may be different and you should consult the
        relevant documentation to be sure.
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      When a top-level transaction is created with a non-zero timeout, it is subject to being rolled back if it has not
      completed within the specified number of seconds. JBoss Transaction Service uses a separate reaper thread which
      monitors all locally created transactions, and forces them to roll back if their timeouts elapse. If the
      transaction cannot be rolled back at that point, the reaper will force it into a rollback-only state so that it
      will eventually be rolled back.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default this thread is dynamically scheduled to awake according to the timeout values for any transactions
      created, ensuring the most timely termination of transactions. It may alternatively be configured to awake at a
      fixed interval, which can reduce overhead at the cost of less accurate rollback timing. For periodic operation,
      change the <varname>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.txReaperMode</varname> property from its default value of
      <literal>DYNAMIC</literal> to <literal>PERIODIC</literal> and set the interval between runs, in milliseconds,
      using the property <varname>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.txReaperTimeout</varname>. The default interval in
      <literal>PERIODIC</literal> mode is 120000 milliseconds.
    </para>
    <warning>
      <para>
        In earlier versions the <literal>PERIODIC</literal> mode was known as <literal>NORMAL</literal> and was the
        default behavior. The use of the configuration value <literal>NORMAL</literal> is deprecated and
        <literal>PERIODIC</literal> should be used instead if the old scheduling behavior is still required.
      </para>
    </warning>
    <para>
      If a value of <literal>0</literal> is specified for the timeout of a top-level transaction, or no timeout is
      specified, then JBoss Transaction Service will not impose any timeout on the transaction, and the transaction will
      be allowed to run indefinitely. This default timeout can be overridden by setting the
      <varname>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.defaultTimeout</varname> property variable when using to the required timeout
      value in seconds, when using ArjunaCore, ArjunaJTA or ArjunaJTS.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        As of JBoss Transaction Service 4.5, transaction timeouts have been unified across all transaction components
        and are controlled by ArjunaCore.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Monitoring transaction timeouts</title>
      <para>
        If you want to be informed when a transaction is rolled back or forced into a rollback-only mode by the reaper,
        you can create a class that inherits from class
        <classname>com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.listener.ReaperMonitor</classname> and overrides the
        <methodname>rolledBack</methodname> and <methodname>markedRollbackOnly</methodname> methods. When registered
        with the reaper via the <methodname>TransactionReaper.addListener</methodname> method, the reaper will invoke
        one of these methods depending upon how it tries to terminate the transaction.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          The reaper will not inform you if the transaction is terminated (committed or rolled back) outside of its
          control, such as by the application.
