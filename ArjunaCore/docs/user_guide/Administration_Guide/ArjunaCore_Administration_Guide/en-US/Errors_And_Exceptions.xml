    This section covers the types and causes of errors and exceptions which may be thrown or reported during a transactional
    application.

              The application has run out of memory, and has thrown an <systemitem>OutOfMemoryError</systemitem>
              exception. <application>ArjunaCore</application> has attempted to do some cleanup, by running the garbage
              collector, before re-throwing the exception. This is probably a transient problem and retrying the
              invocation should succeed.

              An error has occurred, and the error is of such severity that that the transaction system must shut
              down. Prior to this error being thrown the transaction service ensures that all running transactions have
              rolled back. If an application catches this error, it should tidy up and exit. If further work is
              attempted, application consistency may be violated.

          <entry>
            <para>
              An attempt has been made to use the transaction service in a manner inconsistent with the current
              licence. The transaction service will not allow further forward progress for existing or new transactions.

            <para>
              An error occurred while the transaction service attempted to use the object store. Further forward
              progress is not possible.

  <para>
    Object store warnings about access problems on states may occur during the normal execution of crash recovery. This
    is the result of multiple concurrent attempts to perform recovery on the same transaction. It can be safely ignored.
