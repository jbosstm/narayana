  <title>ObjectStore Management</title>
  <para>
    Within the transaction service installation, the object store is updated
    regularly whenever transactions are created, or when
    <application>Transactional Objects for Java</application> is used. In a
    failure-free environment, the only object states which should reside within
    the object store are those which represent objects created with the
    <application>Transactional Objects for Java</application> API.
  </para>
  <para>
    If failures occur, transaction logs may remain in the object store until
    crash recovery facilities resolve the transactions the logs represent. As
    such, it is very important not to delete the contents of the object store
    without due care and attention. Without the relevant logs, it is impossible
    to resolve in-doubt transactions. In addition, if multiple users share the
    same object store, they must exercise caution, and never delete the contents
    of the object store if anyone else is using the object store.
