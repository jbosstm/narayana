/**
 * An annotation for controlling the lifecycle of Short Running Actions (SRAs).
 *
 * Newly created SRAs are uniquely identified and the id is referred to as the SRA context. The context
 * is passed around using a JAX-RS request/response header called SRAClient#SRA_HTTP_HEADER ("Short-Running-Action").
 * The implementation (of the SRA specification) is expected to manage this context and the application
 * developer is expected to declaratively control the creation, propagation and destruction of SRAs
 * using the @SRA annotation. When a JAX-RS bean method is invoked in the context of an SRA any JAX-RS
 * client requests that it performs will carry the same header so that the receiving resource knows that
 * it is inside an SRA context (typically achieved using JAX-RS client filters). Similarly if the
 * {@link SRA#enableJTABridge()} attribute is enabled then a JTA transaction context will be associated for the
 * duration of the method call so that any resources used by the method will be enlisted with the
 * SRA and will be committed or rolled back when the SRA finishes.
 *
 * Resource methods can access the context id, if required, by injecting it via the JAX-RS @HeaderParam
 * annotation or via the {@link SRAClient} API. This may be useful, for example, for associating
 * business work with an SRA.
