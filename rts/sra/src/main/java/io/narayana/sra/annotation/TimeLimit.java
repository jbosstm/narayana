 * Used on {@link SRA} and {@link Rollback} annotations to indicate the maximum time that the SRA or
 * participant should remain active for.
 *
 * When applied at the class level the timeout applies to any method that starts an SRA
 * or causes a participant to be registered (ie when the bean class contains a Commit annotation).
 *
 * In the case of participants the corresponding method that is annotated with {@link Rollback} will
 * be invoked when the time limit is reached.
