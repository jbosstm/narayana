/**
 * When a bean method executes in the context of an LRA any methods in the bean class that are annotated with
 * @Compensate will be used as a compensator for that LRA and when it is present, so too must the
 * {@link Compensate} and {@link Status} annotations. If it is applied to multiple methods an arbitrary one
 * is chosen.
 *
 * If the associated LRA is subsequently cancelled the method annotated with @Compensate will be invoked.
 *
 * The annotation can be combined with {@link TimeLimit} annotation to limit the time that the compensator
 * remains valid, after which the corresponding @Compensate method will be called.
