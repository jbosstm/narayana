= `lra/test` module - integration tests

This module has been designed to simulate an environment with three actors: the LRA coordinator, the LRA participant,
and a client (which in this case is the test class). This is implemented using three JVMs running separately.
This reproduces a production scenario where the LRA coordinator runs independently from the LRA participant(s)
and from the client(s).
All tests are executed with help of https://arquillian.org[Arquillian] platform. In some tests, Arquillian is coupled
with maven plugin to start the runtime and deploy the LRA coordinator.

The `lra/test` module contains the following submodules

* link:./arquillian-extension/[`arquillian-extension`] contains Arquillian extension classes
  which make possible to execute the test modules on supported runtimes
* link:./basic[`basic`] contains integration tests which are written for testing
  the Narayana features of the
  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra[LRA specification]
* link:./tck[`tck`] is a module which is responsible for the execution of
  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/tck[LRA TCK tests]
  with Narayana supported runtimes
* link:./crash[`crash`] hosts tests that simulate a crash of either the LRA coordinator or
  the LRA participant or both. So far, only Wildfly is considered in this module as Quarkus
  does not have an Arquillian adapter to run unmanaged tests

== How to run integration tests

Integration tests are tested with
https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/[Maven Failsafe Plugin], using the target 'verify'.

Single test can be executed with `-Dit.test=...`
To use Failsafe in debug mode, use `-Dmaven.failsafe.debug`

The Failsafe Plugin link:../pom.xml[is configured] to run tests with names
`*IT.java`, `*Tests.java` and `*TestCase.java`.

=== Application runtimes

The module is configured to run two runtimes - https://www.wildfly.org[WildFly]
and link:https://quarkus.io[Quarkus]/link:https://thorntail.io[Thorntail].

When the **WildFly** runtime is used (through the 'arq' profile), two instances of Wildfly are initiated:
 * The first instance is started using WildFly Maven Plugin, then the LRA coordinator is deployed using the WAR produced
 by the module `lra/lra-coordinator-war`
 * The second instance is started using Arquillian, then an LRA participant is deployed
Moreover, the testing class is hosted on separated JVM.

Also, the configuration using **Quarkus** (through the 'arq.thorntail') runs the LRA coordinator and the LRA participant(s)
in two separate JVMs:
 * Quarkus is started with its maven plugin and configured to host Narayana LRA coordinator
 * A Thorntail (Arquillian) container hosts the LRA participant
Again, the testing class is hosted on a separated JVM.

=== Running tests with Quarkus/Thorntail

To start integration tests:

[source,sh]
----
mvn clean verify -Parq.thorntail

# single test in one module (example)
mvn clean verify -Parq.thorntail -pl basic -Dit.test=FailedLRAIT
----

.Configuration options of Quarkus/Thorntail
|===
| Option | Description

| `-Dno.lra.coordinator`
| The Quarkus coordinator is automatically started before the Arquillian executes the test (profile `start.lra.coodinator.before.it.tests`).
This makes the coordinator not to be started.

| `-Dtrace.thorntail.test`
| Thorntail client application starts to use `TRACE` level
for Narayana log messages.

| `-Dtrace.lra.coordinator`
| Quarkus LRA coordinator starts to use `TRACE` level for Narayana log messages.

| `-Ddebug`
| The Thorntail client application will be waiting at port `8787`
for debugger to connect.

| `-Ddebug.coordinator`
| Quarkus LRA coordinator will be waiting at port `lra.coordinator.debug.port`
(by default `8788`) for debugger to connect.

=== Running tests with WildFly

To start all integration tests:

[source,sh]
----
export JBOSS_HOME=<path-to-wildfly-distribution-directory>
mvn clean verify -Parq

# single test in one module
mvn clean verify -Parq -pl basic -Dit.test=FailedLRAIT
----

.Configuration options of WildFly
|===
| Option | Description

| `-Ddebug`
| The WildFly waits at port `8787` for debugger to connect.
