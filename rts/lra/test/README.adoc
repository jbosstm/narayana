= `lra/test` module - integration tests

The `lra/test` module contains the following submodules

* link:./arquillian-extension/[`arquillian-extension`] contains set of
  Arquillian extension classes which makes possible to execute the test modules
  on supported runtimes
* link:./basic[`basic`] contains integration tests which are written for testing
  the Narayana features of the
  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra[LRA specification]
* link:./tck[`tck`] is a module which is responsible for execution of
  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/tck[LRA TCK tests]
  with Narayana supported runtimes

All tests are executed with help of https://arquillian.org[Arquillian] platform.
Arquillian is responsible to launch the runtime and makes possible to execute
the tests.

== How to run integration tests

The itegration tests which should be run on the application runtime
are configured to be started with https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/[Maven Failsafe Plugin].

To run the tests the target `verify` has to be used.
Single test with `-Dit.test=...`.
Debug the Maven test execution with `-Dmaven.failsafe.debug`.

The Failsafe Plugin link:../pom.xml#114[is configured] to run tests with names
`*IT.java`, `*Tests.java` and `*TestCase.java`.

=== Application runtimes

The module is configured to run two runtimes - https://www.wildfly.org[WildFly]
and link:https://quarkus.io[Quarkus]/link:https://thorntail.io[Thorntail].

The **WildFly** runtime deploys the coordinator and the application with the client
library at the same application server. The coordinator is deployed as
a separated `war` archive, and the same the applications which packs together
the LRA client library.

**Quarkus/Thorntail** splits the deployments to two separate JVMs.
The Quarkus is started as Narayana LRA coordinator and
Thorntail packs the client application with the LRA client library.

=== Running tests with Quarkus/Thorntail

To start integration tests:

[source,sh]
----
mvn clean verify -Parq

# single test in one module
mvn clean verify -Parq -pl basic -Dit.test=FailedLRAIT
----

.Configuration options of Quarkus/Thorntail
|===
| Option | Description

| `-Dno.lra.coordinator`
| The Quarkus coordinator is automatically started before the Arquillian executes the test (profile `start.lra.coodinator.before.it.tests`).
This makes the coordinator not to be started.

| `-Dtrace.thorntail.test`
| Thorntail client application starts to use `TRACE` level
for Narayana log messages.

| `-Dtrace.lra.coordinator`
| Quarkus LRA coordinator starts to use `TRACE` level for Narayana log messages.

| `-Ddebug`
| The Thorntail client application will be waiting at port `8787`
for debugger to connect.

| `-Ddebug.coordinator`
| Quarkus LRA coordinator will be waiting at port `lra.coordinator.debug.port`
(by default `8788`) for debugger to connect.

=== Running tests with WildFly

To start all integration tests:

[source,sh]
----
export JBOSS_HOME=<path-to-wildfly-distribution-directory>
mvn clean verify -Parq.wildfly

# single test in one module
mvn clean verify -Parq.wildfly -pl basic -Dit.test=FailedLRAIT
----

.Configuration options of WildFly
|===
| Option | Description

| `-Ddebug`
| The WildFly waits at port `8787` for debugger to connect.
