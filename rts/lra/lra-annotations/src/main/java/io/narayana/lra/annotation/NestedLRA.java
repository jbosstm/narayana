/**
 * <p>
 * Used on the interface or class. Defines that the container will create
 * a new LRA for each method invocation, regardless of whether or not there is
 * already an LRA associated with the caller. These LRAs will then
 * either be top-level LRAs or nested automatically depending upon the
 * context within which they are created.
 * <p>
 * When a nested LRA is closed its' compensators are completed but retained. At any time prior to the enclosing LRA
 * being closed or cancelled the nested LRA can be told to compensate (even though it may have already been told
 * to complete).
 * <p>
 * Compatability with the @LRA annotation: if {@link LRA} is not present @NestedLRA is ignored, otherwise the behaviour depends
 * upon the value of the @LRA type attribute:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>REQUIRED
 *     if there is an LRA present a new LRA is nested under it
 *   <li>REQUIRES_NEW,
 *     the @NestedLRA annotation is ignored
 *  <li>MANDATORY,
 *     a new LRA is nested under the incoming LRA
 *  <li>SUPPORTS,
 *    if there is an LRA present a new LRA is nested under otherwise a new top level LRA is begun
 *  <li>NOT_SUPPORTED,
 *    nested does not make sense and operations on this resource that contain a LRA context will immediately return
 *    with a <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> HTTP status code
 *  <li>NEVER,
 *    nested does not make sense and requests that carry a LRA context will immediately return
 *    with a <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> HTTP status code
 * </ul>
