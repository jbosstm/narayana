  <title>ObjectStore Management</title>
  <para><!-- This is duplicate content from the Installation Guide --> Within the transaction service installation, the
  object store is updated regularly whenever transactions are created, or when <application>Transactional Objects for
  Java</application> is used. In a failure-free environment, the only object states which should reside within the
  object store are those representing objects created with the <application>Transactional Objects for Java</application>
  API.
  </para>

    However, if failures occur, transaction logs may remain in the object store until crash recovery facilities have
    resolved the transactions they represent. As such it is very important that the contents of the object store are not
    deleted without due care and attention, as this will make it impossible to resolve in doubt transactions. In
    addition, if multiple users share the same object store it is important that they realize this and do not simply
    delete the contents of the object store assuming it is an exclusive resource.
