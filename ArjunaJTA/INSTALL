Installing JBossJTA into JBoss 4.0.3SP1
---------------------------------------

The installation of JBossJTA into JBoss 4.0.3SP1 is currently a manual process.
We hope to release an installer in the near future that will automate this
process.

The following steps are required

 - download the tar or zip version of JBoss 4.0.3SP1
 - extract the distribution into an installation directory

 - copy the following jars from the JBossJTA installation into the
   server/XXX/lib directory of the JBoss 4.0.3 SP1 installation
   - lib/jbossjta.jar
   - lib/jbossjta-integration.jar
   - lib/ext/jbossts-common.jar
   - jboss/jboss.jar
   - jboss/jboss-hibernate.jar
 - copy the following jar from the JBossJTA installation into the
   server/XXX/deploy/jboss-aop.deployer directory of the JBoss 4.0.3 SP1
   installation
   - jboss/jboss-aspect-library.jar
 - copy the following configuration file from the JBossJTA installation into
   the server/XXX/conf directory of the JBoss 4.0.3 SP1 installation
   - etc/jbossjta-properties.xml
 - edit the server/XXX/conf/jboss-service.xml file and replace the
   jboss:service=TransactionManager mbean declaration with the following

   <mbean code="com.arjuna.ats.jbossatx.jta.TransactionManagerService"
      name="jboss:service=TransactionManager">
      <attribute name="TransactionTimeout">300</attribute>
   </mbean>

The application server will now be configured to use the JBossJTA transaction
manager instead of the JBoss Transaction Manager.
