Installing JBossJTA into JBoss 4.0.3SP1, 4.0.4GA and 4.0.5GA
------------------------------------------------------------

This version of JBossTS no longer supports these older
JBossAS releases. You probably need JBossTS 4.2.3 instead.


Installing JBossTS 4.3 into JBossAS 4.2
------------------------------------------------------------

Strating with the JBossAS 4.2 release, JBossTS JTA is the default
transaction manager in JBossAS. For most usage there is no need to
reinstall or upgrade the transaction manager. Indeed, we recommend
you stick with the pre-installed version as this has received
more extensive testing.

Should you wish to update your JBossAS 4.2.x release to use
JBossTS JTA 4.3 please take the following steps:

 - download the tar or zip version of the application server
 - extract the distribution into an installation directory

 - copy the following jars from the JBossJTA installation into the
   server/XXX/lib directory of the application server installation
   overwriting the already present .jar files of the same name
   - lib/jbossjta.jar
   - lib/jbossjta-integration.jar
   - lib/ext/jbossts-common.jar
 - copy the following configuration file from the JBossJTA installation into
   the server/XXX/conf directory of the application server installation
   overwriting the existing version
   - etc/jbossjta-properties.xml

Note that JBossTS 4.3 provides a JTA 1.1 implementation, whereas JBossAS
4.2 ships the JTA 1.0.1b API files. You may therefore also need to copy
the JTA 1.1 API into the application server's server/XXX/lib dir
  - lib/ext/jta-1_1-classes.zip

JBossTS 4.3 is the last JBossTS release that will support JBossAS 4.2.
Future releases of JBossTS (4.4 onwards) will integrate with JBossAS 5.0 only.
