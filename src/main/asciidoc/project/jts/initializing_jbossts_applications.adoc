= Initializing {parentProduct} Applications

{parentProduct} must be initialized correctly before any application object is created.
To guarantee this, use the `initORB` and `create_POA` methods described in the _Orb Portability Guide_.
Consult the Orb Portability Guide if you need to use the underlying `ORB_init` and `create_POA` methods provided by the ORB instead of the {parentProduct} methods.
