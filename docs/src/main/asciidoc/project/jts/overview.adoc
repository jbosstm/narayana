== Defining a transaction

A transaction is a unit of work that encapsulates multiple database actions such that that either all the encapsulated actions fail or all succeed.

Transactions ensure data integrity when an application interacts with multiple datasources.

====
.Practical Example
If you subscribe to a newspaper using a credit card, you are using a transactional system.
Multiple systems are involved, and each of the systems needs the ability to roll back its work, and cause the entire transaction to roll back if necessary.
For instance, if the newspaper's subscription system goes offline halfway through your transaction, you don't want your credit card to be charged.
If the credit card is over its limit, the newspaper doesn't want your subscription to go through.
In either of these cases, the entire transaction should fail of any part of it fails.
Neither you as the customer, nor the newspaper, nor the credit card processor, wants an unpredictable (indeterminate) outcome to the transaction.

This ability to roll back an operation if any part of it fails is what {parentProduct} is all about.
This guide assists you in writing transactional applications to protect your data.

"Transactions" in this guide refers to atomic transactions, and embody the "all-or-nothing" concept outlined above.
Transactions are used to guarantee the consistency of data in the presence of failures.
Transactions fulfill the requirements of ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

.ACID Properties
Atomicity::
The transaction completes successfully (commits) or if it fails (aborts) all of its effects are undone (rolled back).

Consistency::
Transactions produce consistent results and preserve application specific invariants.

Isolation::
Intermediate states produced while a transaction is executing are not visible to others.
Furthermore, transactions appear to execute serially, even if they are actually executed concurrently.

Durability::
The effects of a committed transaction are never lost (except by a catastrophic failure).

A transaction can be terminated in two ways: committed or aborted (rolled back).
When a transaction is committed, all changes made within it are made durable (forced on to stable storage, e.g., disk).
When a transaction is aborted, all of the changes are undone.
Atomic actions can also be nested; the effects of a nested action are provisional upon the commit/abort of the outermost (top-level) atomic action.

== Commit protocol

A two-phase commit protocol guarantees that all of the transaction participants either commit or abort any changes made.
<<_img_commit_protocol>> illustrates the main aspects of the commit protocol.

* During phase 1, the action coordinator, `C`, attempts to communicate with all of the action participants, `A` and `B`, to determine whether they will commit or abort.
* An abort reply from any participant acts as a veto, causing the entire action to abort.
* Based upon these (lack of) responses, the coordinator chooses to commit or abort the action.
* If the action will commit, the coordinator records this decision on stable storage, and the protocol enters phase 2, where the coordinator forces the participants to carry out the decision.
The coordinator also informs the participants if the action aborts.
* When each participant receives the coordinator’s phase-one message, it records sufficient information on stable storage to either commit or abort changes made during the action.
* After returning the phase-one response, each participant who returned a commit response must remain blocked until it has received the coordinator’s phase-two message.
* Until they receive this message, these resources are unavailable for use by other actions.
If the coordinator fails before delivery of this message, these resources remain blocked.
However, if crashed machines eventually recover, crash recovery mechanisms can be employed to unblock the protocol and terminate the action.

== Transactional proxies

The action coordinator maintains a transaction context where resources taking part in the action need to be registered.
Resources must obey the transaction commit protocol to guarantee ACID properties.
Typically, the resource provides specific operations which the action can invoke during the commit/abort protocol.
However, some resources may not be able to be transactional in this way.
This may happen if you have legacy code which cannot be modified.
Transactional proxies allow you to use these anomalous resources within an action.

The proxy is registered with, and manipulated by, the action as though it were a transactional resource, and the proxy performs implementation specific work to make the resource it represents transactional.
The proxy must participate within the commit and abort protocols.
Because the work of the proxy is performed as part of the action, it is guaranteed to be completed or undone despite failures of the action coordinator or action participants.

== Nested transactions

Given a system that provides transactions for certain operations, you can combine them to form another operation, which is also required to be a transaction.
The resulting transaction’s effects are a combination of the effects of its constituent transactions.
This paradigm creates the concept of nested subtransactions, and the resulting combined transaction is called the enclosing transaction.
The enclosing transaction is sometimes referred to as the parent of a nested (or child) transaction.
It can also be viewed as a hierarchical relationship, with a top-level transaction consisting of several subordinate transactions.

An important difference exists between nested and top-level transactions.

The effect of a nested transaction is provisional upon the commit/roll back of its enclosing transactions.
The effects are recovered if the enclosing transaction aborts, even if the nested transaction has committed.

Sub-transactions are a useful mechanism for two reasons:

fault-isolation::
If a sub-transaction rolls back, perhaps because an object it is using fails, the enclosing transaction does not need to roll back.
modularity::
If a transaction is already associated with a call when a new transaction begins, the new transaction is nested within it.
Therefore, if you know that an object requires transactions, you can them within the object.
If the object’s methods are invoked without a client transaction, then the object’s transactions are top-level.
Otherwise, they are nested within the scope of the client's transactions.
Likewise, a client does not need to know whether an object is transactional.
It can begin its own transaction.

== The Object Transaction Service (OTS)

The CORBA architecture, as defined by the OMG, is a standard which promotes the construction of interoperable applications that are based upon the concepts of distributed objects.
The architecture principally contains the following components:

Object Request Broker (ORB)::
Enables objects to transparently send and receive requests in a distributed, heterogeneous environment.
This component is the core of the OMG reference model.

Object Services::
A collection of services that support functions for using and implementing objects.
Such services are necessary for the construction of any distributed application.
The Object Transaction Service (OTS) is the most relevant to {productName}.

Common Facilities::
Other useful services that applications may need, but which are not considered to be fundamental.
Desktop management and help facilities fit this category.

The CORBA architecture allows both implementation and integration of a wide variety of object systems.
In particular, applications are independent of the location of an object and the language in which an object is implemented, unless the interface the object explicitly supports reveals such details.
As defined in the OMG CORBA Services documentation, _object services_ are defined as a collection of services (interfaces and objects) that support the basic functions for using and implementing objects.
These services are necessary to construct distributed application, and are always independent of an application domain.
The standards specify several core services including naming, event management, persistence, concurrency control and transactions.

[NOTE]
====
The OTS specification allows, but does not require, nested transactions.
{parentProduct} is a fully compliant version of the OTS version 1.1 draft 5, and support nested transactions.
====

The transaction service provides interfaces that allow multiple distributed objects to cooperate in a transaction, committing or rolling back their changes as a group.
However, the OTS does not require all objects to have transactional behavior.
An object's support of transactions can be none at all, for some operations, or fully.
Transaction information may be propagated between client and server explicitly, or implicitly.
You have fine-grained control over an object's support of transactions.
If your objects supports partial or complete transactional behavior, it needs interfaces derived from interface `TransactionalObject`.

The Transaction Service specification also distinguishes between recoverable objects and transactional objects.
Recoverable objects are those that contain the actual state that may be changed by a transaction and must therefore be informed when the transaction commits or aborts to ensure the consistency of the state changes.
This is achieved be registering appropriate objects that support the Resource interface (or the derived `SubtransactionAwareResource` interface) with the current transaction.
Recoverable objects are also by definition transactional objects.

In contrast, a simple transactional object does not necessarily need to be recoverable if its state is actually implemented using other recoverable objects.
A simple transactional object does not need to participate the commit protocol used to determine the outcome of the transaction since it maintains no state information of its own.

The OTS is a protocol engine that guarantees obedience to transactional behavior.
It does not directly support all of the transaction properties, but relies on some cooperating services:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Persistence/Recovery Service |Supports properties of atomicity and durability.
|Concurrency Control Service |Supports the isolation properties.
|===

You are responsible for using the appropriate services to ensure that transactional objects have the necessary ACID properties.
