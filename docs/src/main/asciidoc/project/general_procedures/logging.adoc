= Logging

The recovery manager and the transaction server services produce log files which are located in the `services/logs/` directory.
Two log files are created per service.

`<service-name>-service.log`::
Contains information regarding whether the service is stopped, started, restarted, or in another state.
`<service-name>.log`::
Contains information logged from the actual service.

To configure what information is logged in these files, edit the appropriate LOG4J configuration files located in `services/config/`.
