		<!-- JSR 181 does not seem to directly define how the handler chain is constructed from this xml,
		    although JSR 109 6.2.2.3 seems to indicate the parser is required to maintain the declared ordering.
		    JSR 224 9.3.2 says the constructed chain is then invoked in reverse order for inbound requests.
		    Since we need the HeaderContextProcessor to be invoked before the InboundBridgeHandler,
		    we therefore list the InboundBridgeHandler first -->
