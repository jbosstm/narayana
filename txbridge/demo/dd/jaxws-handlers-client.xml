        <!-- JSR 181 does not seem to directly define how the handler chain is constructed from this xml,
            although JSR 109 6.2.2.3 seems to indicate the parser is required to maintain the declared ordering.

            Since we need the OutboundBridgeHandler to be invoked before the HeaderContextProcessor,
             we list them in that order -->
