# BA Subordinate Transaction Crash During Complete
#
# This script automates testing of a specific recovery scenario for the
# JBossTS XTS implementation of the WS-BA 1.1 protocol using orchestration
# rules. The basic scenario employs a coordinator, a subordinate coordinator
# and 2 web services running in a single JVM, the second one employing local
# (subordinate) coordination. It checks that the transaction compensates
# all completed participants afetr crashing in the middle of completion.
# The crash happens after the subordinate transaction has been prepared and
# logged to disk but before its proxy participant is able to write a log record.
# The scenario is as follows
# (** indicates intercession by a Byteman rule):
#
# AS boots
# Cient starts a WS-BA transaction T1
# Client invokes web service S1 with enlistPC/CC request
# S1 registers PC/CC participant P1 in T1
# Client invokes subordinate web service S2 with enlistPC/CC request
# S2 creates a subordinate BA transaction T2
# S2 registers CC pseudo-participant PP in T1
# S2 registers PC/CC participant P2 in T2
# Client invokes subordinate web service S2 with enlistPC/CC  request
# S2 resumes T2
# S2 registers PC/CC participant P3 in T2
#
# (PC Participants only)
# Client invokes web service S1 with complete request for P1
# P1 sends completed
# ** Rule system logs receipt of completed from P1
# Client invokes subordinate web service S2 with complete request for P2
# P2 sends completed
# ** Rule system logs receipt of completed from P2
# Client invokes subordinate web service S1 with complete request for P3
# P3 sends completed
# ** Rule system logs receipt of completed from P2
# (end of PC Participants only)
#
# Client initiates transaction close for T1
#
# (CC Participants only)
# Coordinator initiates complete of participant P1
# ** Rule system logs dispatch of complete to P1
# ** Rule system logs receipt of completed from P1
# (end of CC Participants only)
# Coordinator initiates complete of subordinate participant PP
# ** Rule system logs dispatch of complete to PP
# PP calls subordinate coordinator complete
# ** Rule system logs call to complete
#
# (CC Participants only)
# Subordinate coordinator initiates complete of participant P2
# ** Rule system logs dispatch of complete to P1
# ** Rule system logs receipt of completed from P1
# Subordinate coordinator initiates complete of participant P3
# ** Rule system logs dispatch of complete to P1
# ** Rule system logs receipt of completed from P1
# (end of CC Participants only)
#
# Subordinate coordinator calls prepare for T2
# ** Rule system logs prepare
# Subordinate coordinator complete returns
# ** Rule system intercepts return and crashes JVM

#
# Use of this script
#
# The default way of exercising this test is to deploy the xtstest war
# to a single AS and configure it to run the relevant XTS Service Test.
# The web services and coordinator will be located with the client.
# The number of participants and subordinate participants must be
# exactly 3. The  web service(s), client (i.e. the XTS Service Test which
# drives the test) and coordinator and subordinate coordinator service must
# be colocated for this scritp to work (it is possible to distribute all of
# these agents if desired but that woud lrequire more complex script rules).
# The AS should crash when the client closes. At reboot the rest of the test
# should run automatically and the server should be killed after the recovered
# transaction is successfuly replayed.
#
# This script needs to be passed to a Byteman agent in the JVM running
# the coordinator service both at first boot and at reboot. Output will be
# written to file testlog in the working directory of the AS.
#
# XTS Service tests which can operate with this scenario can be selected for
# execution at AS boot by the XTSServiceTestRunnerBean by setting system
# property
#    org.jboss.jbossts.xts.servicetests.XTSServiceTestName
# to the name of a class which will execute the test. This property must
# be defined in the JVM running the AS to which the xtstest war is deployed
# i.e. the client AS. n.b. if the client is colocated with the coordinator then
# this property must be left undefined at AS reboot otherwise the client
# will run again, starting a new TX which may interfere with recovery of the
# crashed TX. It is also possible to run the service test using the form
# interface provided on the xtstest war's main index page.
#
# Available tests include:
#
# org.jboss.jbossts.xts.servicetests.test.ba.subordinate.MultiParticipantCoordinatorCompletionParticipantCloseTest
# this test starts an activity then registers a CC participant with the service whose location is defined by
# system property:
#    org.jboss.jbossts.xts.servicetests.ServiceURL1
# if this is not set the value used defaults to
#    http://localhost:8080/xtstest/xtsservicetest1
# the test then registers two CC participants with a second web service (which must install a
# subordinate transaction) whose location is defined system property:
#    org.jboss.jbossts.xts.servicetests.serviceURL1
# if this is not set the value used defaults to
#    http://localhost:8080/xtstest/xtssubservicetest1
# The test then closes the transaction
#
# org.jboss.jbossts.xts.servicetests.test.ba.subordinate.MultiParticipantParticipantCompletionParticipantCloseTest
# this test starts an activity then registers a PC participant with the service whose location is defined by
# system property:
#    org.jboss.jbossts.xts.servicetests.ServiceURL1
# if this is not set the value used defaults to
#    http://localhost:8080/xtstest/xtsservicetest1
# the test then registers two PC participants with a second web service (which must install a
# subordinate transaction) whose location is defined system property:
#    org.jboss.jbossts.xts.servicetests.serviceURL1
# if this is not set the value used defaults to
#    http://localhost:8080/xtstest/xtssubservicetest1
# The test then sends complete requests for all three participants and
# closes the transaction
#
# Expected output
#
# After the first boot the JVM should exit leaving the following in file testlog
# (the number and order of entries depends upon how many and which type of participants
# are enlisted)
#
#   complete sent for CC coordinator engine XXXXXX ***
#   complete received for CC participant XXXXXX  ***

#   completed sent for CC participant XXXXXX
#   completed received for CC participant XXXXXX
#   prepare for transaction XXXXXX
#   saved to disk transaction XXXXXX
#   JVM exit
#
# n.b. *** indicates trace which may be omitted
#      there should be at least one completed sent/received message received for each CC/PC participant
#        trace for PC participant completed will precede the call to pseudo participant complete
#      there should also be at least one complete sent/received message received for each CC participant
#        plus an extra complete sent/received message for the pseduo-participant (it is always registered as CC)
#      there should be at least one complete called/complete returned message for the pseudo participant
#
# and in some cases there may be repeat messages
#
# After reboot the JVM should exit leaving output in the following format in file
# testlog.
