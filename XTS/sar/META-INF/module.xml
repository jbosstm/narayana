    module declaration for XTS enabling the code to be made available in AS7
    this file and the jars need to be copied to the AS7 modules directory
    in subdirectory org/jboss/xts/main. The XTS service class and the 4 XTS
    web archives for ws-c11 and ws-t11 are depoyed as AS7 client applications
    and they depend on the module to gain access to the XTS classes. Client
    code also needs to depend on this module.
