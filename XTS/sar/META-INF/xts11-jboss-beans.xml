        the XTS services to construct URL handed out as references to the service. these URLS need to
        incorporate the bind address and ports employed by the JBoss Web service. they are needed by
        the all 3 sets of component services, client, participant (web service) and coordinator.

        secondly the coordinator URL properties are used to determine the URL of the coordinator service
        to be contacted when a client begins a WSAT or WSBA transaction. they are only used by the client
        code and they are only needed if the coordinator service is deployed in a container remote from
        the client. If left unset the client uses the bind address and http port values to construct a
        URL addressing a locally deployed coordinator service.

            the transport timings are used  to configure timings in the transport layer
            which manages messages between client and coordinator or participant (web
            service) and coordinator. This layer is common to all 3 XTS components so
            these properties may be set in all deployments. The example settings below
            specify the default values which are all calibrated in milliseconds.

            transportTimeout determines the maximum time a participant or coordinator
            service will wait for a response to a protocol message before assuming that
            the service at the other end has crashed. Note that in some cases,
            particularly in the case of participants a timeout can only be handled by
            resending the message. However, in other cases a timeout may lead to a
            transaction start transition e.g. to aborting. n.b. transportTimeout should
            be significantly greater than initialTransportPeriod which determines how
            frequently messages are resent. The default timeout is 30 seconds which should
            never be exceeded on a local network because of  message delivery delays. If
            your service and coordinator are distributed across internet domains then you
            may possibly need to increase this value.

            initialTransportPeriod is the initial period for which a participant or
            coordinator service will wait before resending a protocol message if it does
            not receive a reply. In cases where a wait is performed the first resend will
            only happen after the initial wait timeout and this property is used to
            determine the period before the second resend. In cases where a wait is not
            performed the resend happens automatically on the assumption that the first
            message must not have reached its destination. Where a response is mandated
            by the transaction protocol resends continue indefinitely at gradually
            increasing intervals - the period roughly doubling every two resends. The
            default period is 5 seconds which should never be exceeded on a local network
            because of message delivery delays.If your service and coordinator are
            distributed across internet domains then you may possibly need to increase
            this value.

            maximumTransportPeriod is the maximum value which the resend period can be
            increased to. It should be significantly larger than initialTransportPeriod
            since there is no point resending messages with high frequency if a the
            server at the other end has been down for a long time. The default maximum
            period is 300 seconds which will only be reached after a message has been
            sent approximately 15 times.

            the coordinator URL properties need only be specified in an XTS client container and even
            then they are only needed if the client is expected to employ a coordinator located in some
            other container. if no URL is set then clients will use the web service bind address and http
            to construct a URL addressing a local XTS coordinator.
        -->

        <!-- if you are using a remote JBoss XTS coordinator you can just redefine the scheme, address, port or
            path to the desired value and the ones left undefined will be defaulted to use the standard XTS
            coordinator URL elements. So, for example if your XTS coordinator services is deployed in another
            AS on host myhost.myorg.com you only need to define property coordinatorHost11 to have value
            myhost.myorg.com and the coordinator address used by clients will be
            http://myhost.myorg.com:8080/ws-c11/ActivationService
            n.b. if the remote machine is using JBoss XTS then you won't want to redefine the port unless
            you have monkeyed around with the port config in the remote AS.
            also you won't need to change the path unless you have tweaked the deployment descriptor to relocate
            the XTS services.
