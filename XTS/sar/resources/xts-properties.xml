    <!--
    This is the XTS configuration file for the supported configuration where only the 1.1 protocol
    implementation is deployed. The original file is called xts-properties11.xml but it is deployed
    as xts-properties.xml. This file is only needed if you are deploying XTS outside of JBoss AS.
    When deployed inside JBoss AS the XTS the beans.xml file in the XTS service archive configures
    the relevant properties using micro-container injection.

    These properties define values which configure operation of all 3 components of the XTS
    implementation, the client services, participant (transactional web service) services and
    the XTS coordinator services. Normally all three components are deployed and configured in a
    single container so one property file serves to configure the behaviour of all three deployments.
    By redefining certain of these properties to have empty values it is possible  to avoid loading
    implementations classes used by the client or coordinator components. In order to fully remove any
    of these three components from a deployment it is also necessary to modify the war deployments which
    expose the service endpoints.

    <!--
	bind address/ports
	the following entries are used by the XTS components to construct
	the URLS handed out when they need to provide a reference to the
	service. These URLs refer to services deployed in the client,
	coordinator or participant web service container so the bind
	properties must always be configured in any XTS deployment.

	In JBoss AS these properties will be injected by the
	microcontainer using values derived from service JBoss Web as
	specified in file jboss-beans.xml. So bind.address will be set
	using the bind address supplied when JBoss AS is started while
	the ports will be derived from the configuration file in the
	server's config directory.

    <!-- transport timeouts
    these properties configure timings in the transport layer which manages messages between client
    and coordinator or participant (web service) and coordinator. This layer is common to all 3 XTS components
    so these properties may be set in all deployments. The example settings below specify the default values
    which are all calibrated in milliseconds.

    transportTimeout determines the maximum time a participant or coordinator service will wait for a response
    to a protocol message before assuming that the service at the other end has crashed. Note that in some cases,
    particularly in the case of participants a timeout can only be handled by resending the message. However,
    in other cases a timeout may lead to a transaction start transition e.g. to aborting. n.b. transportTimeout
    should be significantly greater than initialTransportPeriod which determines how frequently messages are
    resent. The default timeout is 30 seconds which should never be exceeded on a local network because of
     message delivery delays. If your service and coordinator are distributed across internet domains then you
     may possibly need to increase this value.

    initialTransportPeriod is the initial period for which a participant or coordinator service will wait before
    resending a protocol message if it does not receive a reply. In cases where a wait is performed the first
    resend will only happen after the initial wait timeout and this property is used to determine the period
    before the second resend. In cases where a wait is not performed the resend happens automatically on the
    assumption that the first message must not have reached its destination. Where a response is mandated by the
    transaction protocol resends continue indefinitely at gradually increasing intervals - the period roughly
    doubling every two resends. The default period is 5 seconds which should never be exceeded on a local
    network because of message delivery delays.If your service and coordinator are distributed across internet
    domains then you may possibly need to increase this value.

    maximumTransportPeriod is the maximum value which the resend period can be increased to. It should be
    significantly larger than initialTransportPeriod since there is no point resending messages with high
    frequency if a the server at the other end has been down for a long time. The default maximum period is 300
    seconds which will only be reached after a message has been sent approximately 15 times.

    <!-- coordinator URL

	If a full URL is provide then it will be used as given.
	Otherwise a URL will be constructed using any URL components
	such as scheme, host etc which have been specified as properties
	and defaulting any remaining unspecified properties.
