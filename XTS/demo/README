This is the raw demo source directory for the XTS demo program
(XTS/demo). Do not attempt to build the demo from this directory as it
will not work.

Run the command 'ant clean install' in the parent directory (XTS).
This will:

  - create the xts install directory (XTS/xts-install)

  - build and install the XTS libraries, web apps and config files and

  - install a preprocessed version of the demo source tree ready for
    building

To build the demo change to the demo directory in the xts install tree
(XTS/xts-install/demo) and follow the instructions in file BUILDING.

Read the installed html documentation (XTS/xts-install/demo/html) for
an explanation of how the demo works and guidelines on how to use the
XTS package to implement your own transactional web services.

Read the programmers guide (XTS/xts-install/docs/ProgrammersGuide.pdf)
for further information.
