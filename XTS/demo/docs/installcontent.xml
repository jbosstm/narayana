                    The installer should have installed the following directories under &lt;ats 4.1 install&gt;/wst directory:
                    <ul>
                        <p>conf: product configuration files.</p>
                        <p>coordinator: an application independent version of the transaction coordinator.</p>
                        <p>demo: a sample application and introductory documentation.</p>
                        <p>docs: product manuals and API javadocs.</p>
                        <p>lib: jar files for the JBossTS components and their 3rd party prerequisites.</p>
                        <p>webapps: pre built J2EE web applications for the product components.</p>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, you will require a Web services platform on which to deploy and run the product.
				    This release of the XML Transaction component of ATS 4.1 is designed to run within webMethods.
				</p>
				<p>
    				This release has been tested on webMethods 5.0.2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To compile, deploy and run the sample application we also recommend using java SDK 1.4.2 and Apache ant 1.6.1 or later.
                    If you do not already have these, you can download them from <a class="linkscoloured" href="http://java.sun.com/">java website</a> and the <a class="linkscoloured" href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant website</a>.
