                    The installer should have installed the following directories under directory &lt;jbossts 4.4.0 xts&gt;/xts-install:
                    <ul>
                        <p>conf: product configuration files.</p>
                        <p>demo: a sample application and introductory documentation.</p>
                        <p>docs: product manuals and API javadocs.</p>
                        <p>lib: jar files for the JBossTS components and their 3rd party prerequisites.</p>
                        <p>sar: deployable JBoss service archive containing the XTS 1.0 and 1.1 implementation.</p>
                        <p>webapps: pre built J2EE web applications for the product components.</p>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, you will require a Web services platform on which to deploy and run the product.
				    This release of the XML Transaction component of JBossTS 4.4.0 is designed to run within JBoss.
				</p>
				<p>
    				This release has been tested on JBoss 5.0.0.CR1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To compile, deploy and run the sample application we also recommend using java SDK 1.5 and Apache ant 1.6.1 or later.
                    If you do not already have these, you can download them from <a class="linkscoloured" href="http://java.sun.com/">java website</a> and the <a class="linkscoloured" href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant website</a>.
