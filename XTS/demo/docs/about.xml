                    The sample application features some simple transactional Web services, a client application, deployment metadata files and a build script.
                    The application is designed to introduce some of the key features of the XML Transaction component of JBossTS 4.2.2 and help you get started with writing your own transactional Web services applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application is based around a simple booking scenario. The services provide the ability to transactionally reserve resources,
                    whilst the client provides an interface to select the nature and quantity of the reservations.
                    The chosen application domain is services for a night out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server components consist of three Web services (Restaurant, Theatre, Taxi) which offer transactional booking services.
                    These services each expose a GUI with state information and an event trace log.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The client side of the application is a servlet which allows the user to select the required reservations and then books a night out by making invocations on each of the services within the scope of a Web Services transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Full source code for the services and the client is included, along with an ant script for building and deploying the code.
                    The following step of this trail map will show you how to deploy and run the application.
