This demo has been written for, and tested on, JBoss5.0Beta4.  Please download
and install this app server from the JBoss website.

Follow these steps to build the demo for JBoss
 - edit jboss.properties and replace variables as directed in the comments
 - add java and ant to your path
 - set environment variable JBOSS_HOME to point to the root directory of an
   instance of JBoss5.0Beta4
 - execute 'sh build.sh jboss clean build' on unix or
   'build.bat jboss clean build' on windows
 - deploy the generated ear file into an instance of JBoss5.0Beta4

Open a browser and enter the xts-demo url (e.g. http://localhost:8080/xts-demo)

An alternative version of the demo can be built using JaxRPC instead
of JaxWS. Thsi can be built by supplying the argument 'buildrpc' in
place of 'build' on the 'execute' command line detailed above. Deploy
and access using the same url.
