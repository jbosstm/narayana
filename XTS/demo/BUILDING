This demo has been written for, and tested on, JBoss Application Server 4.2.1.GA.  
Please download and install this app server from the JBoss website. This demo has
been tested on JBoss Transaction Service 4.4.

Follow these steps to build the demo for JBoss

1) Add 'java' and 'ant' to your path

2) Edit 'build.xml' and replace properties as directed in the comments

3) Execute 'ant build'
   This compiles necessary classes and produces the 'xts-demo.ear' file.

4) Execute 'ant deploy'
   This deploys the generated ear file into an instance of the JBoss Application
   Server

To start using the demo application open a browser and enter the xts-demo url 
(e.g. http://localhost:8080/xts-demo)

To undeploy the demo application execute 'ant undeploy' - this deletes the
'xts-demo.ear' file from the deployment directory of the JBoss AS.
