This demo has been written for, and tested on, JBoss5.0.CR1.
Please download and install one of these app servers from the
JBoss website.

Follow these steps to build the demo for JBoss
 - edit jboss.properties and replace variables as directed in the comments
 - add java and ant to your path
 - set environment variable JBOSS_HOME to point to the root directory of an
   instance of JBoss5.0.0.CR1
 - execute 'sh build.sh jboss clean deploy' on unix or
   'build.bat jboss clean deploy' on windows

Open a browser and enter the xts-demo url (e.g. http://localhost:8080/xts-demo)

An alternative version of the demo can be built using JaxRPC instead
of JaxWS by supplying the argument 'deployrpc' in place of 'deploy' on
the 'execute' command line detailed above.

n.b. deployment of the demo to JbossAS 5.0.CR1 assumes that the XTS
has already been deployed as a service archive (sar). See the INSTALL
file in your ArjunaJTA or ArjunaJTS install tree for instructions on how
to perform this deployment.
