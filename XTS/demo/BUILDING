This demo has been written for, and tested on, JBoss4.2.2.GA and
JBoss5.0Beta4. Please download and install one of these app servers
from the JBoss website.

Follow these steps to build the demo for JBoss
 - edit jboss.properties and replace variables as directed in the comments
 - add java and ant to your path
 - set environment variable JBOSS_HOME to point to the root directory of an
   instance of JBoss4.2 or JBoss5.0Beta4
 - for JBoss5.0Beta4 execute 'sh build.sh jboss clean deploy' on unix or
   'build.bat jboss clean deploy' on windows
 - for JBoss4.2 execute 'sh build.sh jboss clean sa-deploy' on unix or
   'build.bat jboss clean sa-deploy' on windows

Open a browser and enter the xts-demo url (e.g. http://localhost:8080/xts-demo)

An alternative version of the demo can be built using JaxRPC instead
of JaxWS. For JBoss5.0.Beta4 this can be built by supplying the
argument 'deployrpc' in place of 'deploy' on the 'execute' command
line detailed above. For JBoss4.2 it can be built by supplying the
argument 'sa-deployrpc' in place of 'sa-deploy'. Access the demo using
the same url.

n.b. deployment of the demo to JbossAS 5.0Beta4 assumes that the XTS
has already been deployed as a service archive (sar). See the INSTALL
file in your ArjunaJTS install tree for instructions on how to perform
this deployment. XTS sar deployment currently requires the web
listener hostname and port to be "localhost" and "8080". This
restriction will be lifted in future releases. Use of a stand alone
coordinator is also not currently supported in JbossAS 5.0Beta4.
