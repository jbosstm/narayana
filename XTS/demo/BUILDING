This demo has been written for, and tested on, JBoss 7.0.2. It may work with other versions of JBoss 7.
Please download and install this app server from the JBoss website.

ensure JBoss AS is started with XTS enabled. This can be done by specifying the standalone-xts configuration when starting JBoss AS:

cd $JBOSS_HOME
sh bin/standalone.sh -server-config=standalone-xts.xml -Djava.awt.headless=false

Note: The java.awt.headless property is needed for the demo as it starts a Java Swing user interface for each or the participant services. This is done for demonstration purposes; it is unlikely that a typical JEE application will ever do this. 


Follow these steps to build the demo for JBoss
 - edit jboss.properties and replace variables as directed in the comments
 - add java and ant to your path
 - set environment variable JBOSS_HOME to point to the root directory of an
   instance of JBoss 7
 - execute 'sh build.sh jboss clean deploy' on unix or
   'build.bat jboss clean deploy' on windows

Open a browser and enter the xts-demo url (e.g. http://localhost:8080/xts-demo)
