/**
 * <p>The org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.Compensatable annotation provides the application
 * the ability to declaratively control compensation transaction boundaries on CDI managed beans, as
 * well as classes defined as managed beans by the Java EE specification, at both the class
 * and method level where method level annotations override those at the class level.</p>
 * <p>This support is provided via an implementation of CDI interceptors that conduct the
 * necessary suspending, resuming, etc. The Compensatable interceptor interposes on business method
 * invocations only and not on lifecycle events. Lifecycle methods are invoked in an unspecified
 * transaction context.</p>
 * <p>The TxType element of the annotation indicates whether a bean method is to be executed within
 * a transaction context.  TxType.REQUIRED is the default.</p>
 * <p>By default checked exceptions do not result in the transactional interceptor marking the transaction for rollback
 * and instances of RuntimeException and its subclasses do. This default behavior can be modified by specifying
 * exceptions that result in the interceptor marking the transaction for rollback and/or exceptions that do not result in rollback.</p>
