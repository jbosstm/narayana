			<html>

<p>The JTS version of the Banking application means that the Object Request Broker
  will be used. The JBossTS distribution is provided to works with JacORB version
  2.1 that can be obtained from the arjuna product page. JBossTS works also
  with Orbix 2000 v2.0, for more details see the ORB configuration section of the
  <a class="linkscoloured" href="../../docs/user_guide/ProgrammersGuide.pdf" target="_blank">Programmers Guide (pdf)</a>
  </p>
<p>To describe the possibilities provided by JBossTS to build a transactional
  application according to the programming models defined by the OTS specification,
  the Banking Application is programmed in different ways. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Local transactions: The Bank Client and the Bank server are collocated in
    the same process.</li>
  <li>Distributed Transactions: The Bank Client and the Bank Server and located
    on different process. To participate within a client's transaction, Account
    Objects needed to access the transactional context. We describe the two of
    context propagation.
    <ul>
      <li>implicit context propagation, and</li>
      <li>explicit context propagation. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
