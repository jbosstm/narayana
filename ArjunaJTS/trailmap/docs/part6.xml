				<p>
					The way the banking application is built and
					deployed in the previous trail does not it make it
					persistent, in such way that any created account can
					be retrieved later after stopping the bank server or
					if the application crashes; moreover, it does not
					allow concurrent access to accounts without leading
					to inconsistent values.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two ways will be presented in this trail on the way
					to build the banking application as a persistent and
					sharable application:
