 * null out our reference when our shutdown methods are called.
 * This is more of an issue for multi-threaded applications, where
 * one thread "shuts" the system down, while other threads are still
 * active. So, we have state variables to allow us to tell whether
 * the system is supposed to be shutdown. This then allows us to
 * support multiple initialisations.
