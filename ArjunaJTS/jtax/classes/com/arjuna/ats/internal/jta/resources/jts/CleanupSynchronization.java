 * This synchronization is responsible for removing the JTA transaction
 * from the internal table. We don't need one for the purely local JTA
 * implementation, since the transaction implementation will do this
 * itself. However, in the JTS implementation, where a subordinate JTA
 * transaction may be proxied in another JVM, we have to rely on the
 * synchronization to do the garbage collection, since that transaction
 * implementation won't be driven through commit or rollback - it'll go
 * through the 2PC methods at the JTS interposition hierarchy level.
