This test illustrates  the difference  between registering a  Resource
and a  SubtransactionAwareResource   with a nested   transaction.  The
Resource   will  only be   called   during the  top-level  transaction
commit/abort, whereas the SubtransactionAwareResource will be informed
when    the    nested       transaction    terminates.      If     the
SubtranscationAwareResource  was  registered  using  register_resource
(the default in  this example) it  will be propagated to the top-level
transaction; otherwise it will not. Use the -subtran option to see the
differences.

Not a remote test.
