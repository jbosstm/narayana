    Since the release of JBossTS 4.1, the Web Services Transaction product has been merged into JBoss
    Transactions. JBoss Transactions is thus a single product that is compliant with all of the major distributed transaction
    standards and specifications.

  <para>
    Knowledge of Web Services is not required to administer a JBoss Transactions installation that only uses the
    CORBA/J2EE component, nor is knowledge of CORBA required to use the Web Services component. This, administrative
    tasks are separated when they touch only one component or the other.

  <para>
    Apart from ensuring that the run-time system is executing normally, there is little continuous administration needed
    for the JBossJTS software. Refer to <xref linkend="important_points_for_administrators" /> for some specific
    concerns.

        The present implementation of the JBossJTS system provides no security or protection for data. The objects
        stored in the JBossJTS object store are (typically) owned by the user who ran the application that created
        them. The Object Store and Object Manager facilities make no attempt to enforce even the limited form of
        protection that Unix/Windows provides. There is no checking of user or group IDs on access to objects for either
        reading or writing.

      <para>
        Persistent objects created in the Object Store never go away unless the StateManager.destroy method is invoked
        on the object or some application program explicitly deletes them. This means that the Object Store gradually
        accumulates garbage (especially during application development and testing phases). At present we have no
        automated garbage collection facility. Further, we have not addressed the problem of dangling references. That
        is, a persistent object, A, may have stored a Uid for another persistent object, B, in its passive
        representation on disk. There is nothing to prevent an application from deleting B even though A still contains
        a reference to it. When A is next activated and attempts to access B, a run-time error will occur.

        There is presently no support for version control of objects or database reconfiguration in the event of class
        structure changes. This is a complex research area that we have not addressed. At present, if you change the
        definition of a class of persistent objects, you are entirely responsible for ensuring that existing instances
        of the object in the Object Store are converted to the new representation. The JBossJTS software can neither
        detect nor correct references to old object state by new operation versions or vice versa.

        Object store management is critically important to the transaction service.
