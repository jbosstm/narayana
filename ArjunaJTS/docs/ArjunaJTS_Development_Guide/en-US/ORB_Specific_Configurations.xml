      Take care to use only the patched version of JacORB shipped with JBossTS. Correct functioning of the transaction
      system, particularly with regard to crash recovery, is unlikely to work with an unpatched JacORB.  For each
      deployment of JacORB, ensure that the <varname>jacorb.implname</varname> in the
      <filename>jacorb.properties</filename> file is unique.
