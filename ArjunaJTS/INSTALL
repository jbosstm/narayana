Installing JBossJTS into JBoss 4.0.3SP1, 4.0.4GA and 4.0.5GA
------------------------------------------------------------

The installation of JBossJTS into JBoss AS is currently a manual process.
We hope to release an installer in the near future that will automate this
process.

The following steps are required

 - download the tar or zip version of the application server
 - extract the distribution into an installation directory

 - copy the following jars from the JBossJTS installation into the
   server/XXX/lib directory of the application server installation
   - lib/jbossjts.jar
   - lib/jbossjts-jacorb.jar
   - lib/jbossjts-integration.jar
   - lib/ext/jbossts-common.jar
 - copy the following configuration file from the JBossJTS installation into
   the server/XXX/conf directory of the application server installation
   - etc/jbossjts-properties.xml
 - edit the server/default/conf/jbossjts-properties.xml file and remove the
   recovery extension property containing the value
   "com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.recovery.jts.XARecoveryModule"
 - edit the server/all/conf/jbossjts-properties.xml file and remove the
   recovery extension property containing the value
   "com.arjuna.ats.internal.jta.recovery.arjunacore.XARecoveryModule"

 - Edit the server/all/conf/jboss-service.xml file and replace the
   jboss:service=TransactionManager mbean declaration with the following

   <mbean code="com.arjuna.ats.jbossatx.jts.TransactionManagerService"
      name="jboss:service=TransactionManager">
      <depends>jboss:service=CorbaORB</depends>
      <attribute name="TransactionTimeout">300</attribute>
   </mbean>

 - Edit the server/default/conf/jboss-service.xml file and replace the
   jboss:service=TransactionManager mbean declaration with the following

   <mbean code="com.arjuna.ats.jbossatx.jta.TransactionManagerService"
      name="jboss:service=TransactionManager">
      <attribute name="TransactionTimeout">300</attribute>
   </mbean>

 - Edit the server/all/conf/jacorb.properies as follows.
  - change the jacorb.poa.thread_pool_max property to 32

 - Edit the server/all/deploy/iiop-service.xml and modify the
   PortableInterceptorInitializers attribute as follows.
  - remove the following lines
         <!-- comment out to disable null transaction propagation over IIOP -->
         <initializer>org.jboss.tm.iiop.TxServerClientInterceptorInitializer</initializer>
         <!-- comment out to disable transaction demarcation over IIOP -->
         <initializer>org.jboss.tm.iiop.TxServerInterceptorInitializer</initializer>
  - add the following lines
         <!-- JBoss TS interceptor -->
         <initializer>com.arjuna.ats.jts.orbspecific.jacorb.interceptors.interposition.InterpositionORBInitializerImpl</initializer>

Replace jacorb.jar in client and server/all/lib with the jacorb.jar located in the jacorb directory.

For each deployment of JacORB, you will need to ensure that the jacorb.implname in the jacorb.properties
file is unique.

Application Server Library Modifications
----------------------------------------

The JBoss 4.0.3SP1, 4.0.4GA and 4.0.5GA application servers require some
modified librarires before JBossJTA can be used as a replacement.  These
are detailed in the appropriate subdirectory of the jboss directory within
this installation.

No modifications are required if you are running a cumulative patch for
JBoss 4.0.4GA.

The application server will now be configured to use the JBossJTS transaction
manager instead of the JBoss Transaction Manager.

Web Services Transactions
-------------------------

For the Web Services Transactions component (also known as the XML Transaction Service, or XTS),
in order to create a stand-alone coordinator:

(1) create a separate installation of your application server to the one you
will use for your clients/services.

(2) edit the build.xml to point to this installation.

You need to set hostname, port and deploy.dir parameters to those for the
application server used for the stand-alone coordinator.

(3) run ant with the deploy target that matches your application server
(deploy-webmethods, deploy-weblogic or deploy-jboss).

(4) when running clients and services, edit the wstx.xml file in their
deployment to add

	    <property
	    name="com.arjuna.mw.wst.coordinatorURL"
	    value="http://@hostname@:@port@/xts/soap/ActivationCoordinator"/>

	    <property
	    name="com.arjuna.mw.wst.ba.terminatorURL"
	    value="http://@hostname@:@port@/xts/soap/TerminatorParticipant"/>

where hostname and port are replaced with the appropriate values.

(5) make sure you start  your coordinator deployment before any clients or
services that may want to use it.

We recommend that you run through the XTS trailmap in order to understand how to build and use
transaction-aware Web Services, before deciding whether or not to use a stand-alone coordinator service.

Note, the following issues exist with the XTS trailmap shipped with JBossTS

(i) The XTS trailmap demo application generates warning messages on the
application server console if it is run in JBoss 4.0.4GA or 4.0.5GA.  These
warnings do not affect the funtionality of the demo application.

The warning is:
  [JSR109ServerMetaDataBuilder] Cannot obtain SEI mapping for:
