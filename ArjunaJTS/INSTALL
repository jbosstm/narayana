JBossTS 4.15 is designed for use standalone.
The JTA is also used by JBossAS 7 beta releases, but manual upgrading of the component inside JBossAS is not recommended.
 JTS and XTS are not currently available in AS7.
Integration with JBossAS 6 or earlier is no longer supported.

JMX Instrumentation
-------------------

With this release it is now possible to monitor the transaction Object
Store using JMX. Monitoring the Object Store is useful for trouble
shooting problems that occur when transactions are committed (it does
not expose transactions prior to commit). The JMX instrumentation
(of the ObjectStore) is a new feature and is not necessarily suitable
for monitoring production systems.

In any compliant JMX browser (such as jconsole) there should appear an
MBean with the name
    jboss.jta:type=ObjectStore
This MBean corresponds to the object store and provides a naming context
for other MBeans (for example in a JMX client such as jconsole the MBeans
will be displayed in the form of a tree control). The various MBeans
corresponding to this ObjectStore will have names prefixed by this
'top level' MBean.

Simply instantiate an object of type com.hp.mwtests.ts.arjuna.tools.ObjStoreBrowser
and initialise it with a valid set of types for handling ObjectStore records. These types
can be set using a setTypes() method via a properties file on the classpath.
Please refer to the unit tests in the src distribution for more details.

Tools Deployment
----------------

Transaction management is integrated into the admin console in the form of a JOPR plugin
which is located in the install bin directory (jbossts-jopr-plugin.jar). Install it by copying
to the admin console plugin directory ($JBOSS_HOME/common/deploy/admin-console.war/plugins).

There is also a transaction statistics graphing tool which can run standalone or inside a
jconsole tab (jconsole, a tool for managing JVMs, is distributed with the reference JDK).
Various transaction statistics are graphed in real time with each graph updated during each
poll interval (4 seconds unless the interval is overridden on the jconsole command line).

The tool depends on the JFree graphing library. Download and upack Orson from http://www.jfree.org/orson
and set the env variable ORSON_HOME to the directory where you plan to unpack the downloaded zip.
If you intend to use the tool with jconsole you will also need to put the JDK tools and jconsole jars on
the classpath:

export CLASSPATH="$JDK_HOME/lib/tools.jar:$JDK_HOME/lib/jconsole.jar:$ORSON_HOME/orson-0.5.0.jar:$ORSON_HOME/lib/jfreechart-1.0.6.jar:$ORSON_HOME/lib/jcommon-1.0.10.jar:$TS_INSTALL_DIR/lib/jbossjts.jar>"

Standalone Usage:

java com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.tools.stats.TxPerfGraph

(note that standalone usage does not require the JDK tools and jconsole jars)

Usage with jconsole:

jconsole -J-Djava.class.path="$CLASSPATH" -pluginpath $TS_INSTALL_DIR/lib/jbossjts.jar

The tool will automatically enable statistics gathering on startup. It is recommended that you disable statistics gathering prior to exit on the Settings tab in the GUI.
