/**
 * Provides a callback handler for compensating any work done within this annotated method (or all methods of the class
 * when annotated at the class level). The callback is used later if the compensation-based transaction is cancelled and is
 * used to undo any work completed by the associated method.
 *
 * The compensation handler is only registered if the method completes successfully (i.e doesn't throw a RuntimeException, or subclass thereof).
 *
 * If the method fails, (i.e. throws a RuntimeException or subclass thereof) it is expected that the method leaves the
 * application in a consistent state as none of the registered handlers will be invoked.
