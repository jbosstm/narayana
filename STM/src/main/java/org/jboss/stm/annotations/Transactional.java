/**
 * Defines that implementations of the interface are to be managed within a transactional
 * container. Unless specified using other annotations, all public
 * methods will be assumed to modify the state of the object, i.e.,
 * require write locks. All state variables will be saved/restored
 * by default unless it is marked using the @State annotation or 
 * SaveState/RestoreState.
 * 
 * This assumes currently that all state modification and locking occurs through
 * public methods. This means that even if there are private, protected or
 * package scope methods that would change the state, they will not be tracked.
 * Therefore, the implementation class should not modify state unless by calling
 * its own public methods.
 * 
 * All methods should either be invoked within a transactional context or have
 * the Nested annotation applied, wherein the system will automatically create a
 * new transaction when the method is invoked.
 * 
 * NOTE this annotation needs to be provided on the interface so that the container
 * knows to create proxy objects for the derived types once it sees them.

/*
 * TODO fix this, so that we can either proxy private, protected and package
 * methods, or provide a means whereby the implementation class can inform the
 * transaction system. For instance, maybe the implementation class can call into
 * the container that maintains the proxy, passing itself as a reference, and
 * drive setlock, modified etc. implicitly.

/*
 * TODO check that the restriction on public method access is still true!
