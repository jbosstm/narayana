/**
 * This is a user-level transaction class. Unlike AtomicAction which it uses, this
 * provides an asynchronous begin, commit and rollback capability. There
 * are a number of ways in which we currently support asynchronous interactions with
 * the transaction system, such as async prepare or async commit. The developer could
 * also register a two-phase aware participant or a Synchronisation and use callbacks
 * themselves to determine the outcome of the transaction. These continue to be
 * available to the developer but this API is intended to provide a simplified interface
 * to allow clients to make use of asynchronous transactions.
 * 
 * Note, we deliberately don't derive from AtomicAction so that developers must make
 * a conscious choice between a synchronous or asynchronous transaction.
