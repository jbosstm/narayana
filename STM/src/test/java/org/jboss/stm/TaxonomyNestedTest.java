/**
 * <p>
 * There are no standards for STM and there are different models for how nested transactions behave.
 * The following tests investigate the behaviour of the Narayana Software Transactional Memory
 * implementation with respect to nested transactions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The tests are meant to supplement the STM discussion introduced
 * <a href="https://jbossts.blogspot.com/2018/09/tips-on-how-to-evaluate-stm.html">in an online article</a>
 * and include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>checking that committing changes made by a closed nested transaction should be visible to the parent</li>
 *   <li>checking that aborting changes made by a closed nested transaction should not be visible to the parent</li>
 * </ul>
 * The tests are ran in two configurations:
 *   <li>run the nested action in the same thread as the parent action</li>
 *   <li>run the nested action in a different thread from the one used by the parent action</li>
 * </p>
