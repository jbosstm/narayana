/**
 * Implementation of the InboundTransactionCurrent interface of the app server's
 * transaction integration SPI. Provides a way for app server code to obtain the
 * transaction that was on an inbound CORBA call. The context processing on the
 * wire is handled by the JTS's RequestInterceptors, here we just provide a way
 * to expose that context to the app server.
