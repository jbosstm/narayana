# Any Logger created by the Logger Factory is by default enabled.
# To disable logging requests the following property shall be set to YES

#LOG_DISABLED=YES


#========================================================================
# Any Logger created by the Logger Factory is by default set to the DEBUG
# Level. The following property allows to modify it default level.
# Possible Values are: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL 
# If LOG_DISABLED is set to YES, logging requests are discarded whatever
# the value assigned to LOGGER_LEVEL

# To determine if Finer debugging should be provided by these commonLogger
# FinerDebug is used prefixed by the complete name of the commonLogger.
# By default finer debugging is set to NO, otherwise it should be set to YES

com.hp.mwtests.commonlogging.debugextension.FinerDebug=YES

#========================================================================
# If the FinerDebug is set to "YES", the following finer debugging 
# classes should be provided, where
# - dClass is the name (with complete path) of the class implementing
#   the DebugLevel interface
# - fClass is the name (with complete path) of the class implementing
#   the FacilityCode interface
# - vClass is the name (with complete path) of the class implementing

#=========================================================================
# If Finer debugging classes are provided, the following properties define
