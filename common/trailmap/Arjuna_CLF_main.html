<h1>
The Arjuna Common Logging Framework</h1></center>

<p><br>Given the multitude of logging APIs, most organizations are hesitant
to tie their code to a particular API, considering that an other API may
offer better
<br>functionalities or even better performance. This is particularly the
case with log4j considering the new logging API included in JDK 1.4. The
aim of the Arjuna Common Logging Framework is to provide a high level interface
hiding the type of an underlying logging API in order to offer a portability
of a source code, which requires logging, then providing a better migration
if needed.
