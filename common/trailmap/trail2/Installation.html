<h2>
2. Install the Common Logging Framework</h2>
In order to use the tools we are about to install it is necessary to setup
the operating environment so that the tools know where to find stuff they
need and the operating system knows where to find the tools. A understanding
of how to do this is essential as you will be asked to change the operating
environment. I have comprehensively covered this in documents entitled
Configuring A Windows Working Environment and Configuring A Unix Working
Environment.
<p>The Common Logging Framework is distributed with a set of jar files
(under the /lib directory) that need to be added in your CLASSPATH
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>clf.jar</font></font> -
This files must be added in your CLASSPATH. It contains common functionalities
whatever the underlying logging used, and offer the simple logging implementation
that can be used if no any underlying logging.</li>

<br><i>This jar file can run with JDK 1.1 or above.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>clf_log4j.jar</font></font>
- This files must be added in your CLASSPATH if you intend to use log4j
as the underlying logging. The clf_log4j.jar contains the appropriate classes
allowing to wrap log4j.</li>

<br>In this case you must add the appropriate jar files provided by the
log4j distribution - log4j.jar and log4j-core.jar. In its current version
the CLF support the version 1.1.3 of log4j.
<br><i>The version of log4j is based on JDK 1.1</i>
<br><i></i>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>clf_csf.jar</font></font>
- This files must be added in your CLASSPATH if you intend to use HP logging
as the underlying logging. The clf_csf.jar contains the appropriate classes
allowing to wrap log4j.</li>

<br>In this case you must add the appropriate jar files provided by the
HP logging distribution - common.jar.
<br><i>The jar file common.jar is based on JDK 1.?? (need to check)</i>
